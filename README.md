# About this Notebook

Implementation of 
- **Heteroscedastic aleatoric uncertainty** as described in the paper [What Uncertainties Do We Need in Bayesian Deep Learning for Computer Vision?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04977). 
- **Epistemic uncertainty** using deep ensembles from [Simple and Scalable Predictive Uncertainty Estimation using Deep Ensembles](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.01474)
- **Combined aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty** using the approach described in [What Uncertainties Do We Need in Bayesian Deep Learning for Computer Vision?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04977), but with ensembles for epistemic uncertainty (and obviously not "in one model" because this implementation uses deep ensembles)


[marcobellagente93/Bayesian_Regression](https://github.com/marcobellagente93/Bayesian_Regression/blob/main/Bayesian_regression_notebooks/noisy_sin_example.ipynb) was used as reference for this notebook. The dataset generation is the same as in the notebook, and the plots are also inspired by it.
