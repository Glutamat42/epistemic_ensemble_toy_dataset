# About this Notebook

Implementation of 
- **Heteroscedastic Aleatoric Uncertainty** as described in the paper [What Uncertainties Do We Need in Bayesian Deep Learning for Computer Vision?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04977). 
- **Epistemic Uncertainty** using deep ensembles from [Simple and Scalable Predictive Uncertainty Estimation using Deep Ensembles](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.01474)
- **Combined Aleatoric and Epistemic uncertainty** using the approach described in [What Uncertainties Do We Need in Bayesian Deep Learning for Computer Vision?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04977), but with ensembles for epistemic uncertainty (and obviously not "in one model" because I use ensembles)
